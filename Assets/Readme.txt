===IndividualGames Coding Standards===

> Private members prefixed m_ in Camel.

> Parameters prefixed a_ in Camel.

> Private consts prefixed c_ in Camel.

> Public members in Pascal.

> Everything else pretty much modern Unity standard.

> Well spaced, even lines as much as possible.

> Double space between methods and after fields end.

> Well grouped fields and caching as much as possible.

> [SerializedField] on top. Then ordered by accesibility.

> Braces on ifs, regardless of line amount.

> Lambda as much as possible on Properties and Switch. Never on methods.

> I refrain from using Is- Get- Set- prefixes as they feel tired and overused. IsBlocked --> Blocked, GetPlayerHealth --> PlayerHealth

> Anywhere I forget these, please forgive.  :>
